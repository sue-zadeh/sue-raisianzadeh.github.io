      <p class="p-questions"> &#9680; What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
      </p>  
   
       <p class="answer"> &#9658; I like to imoprove my skills and learn more about cores and find a tech job.
         My greatest strength to achieve my goal is my passion for coding.
           But I think I need to practice more on coding and cores, I worked in many groups, but working in a dev team is different.
           Speaking in front of a group and focusing on what I'm doing is another thing I need to improve through bootcamp.</br>
           I need to know myself and my abilities so that I can change my habits or make my good habits stronger 
           to be more successful in reaching my goals and improving myr self-awareness and reflective skills.</br>
           Working on my EQ and growing my brain to become more powerful to learn and recall information when needed is another thing I like to do.</br>
           I believe that working in the boot camp will help me achieve my goal better. As it is face-to-face study. So it is much easier to get help
            , and working in a team can improve skills better.
            I hope to see developed communication and giving and receiving feedback in myself, 
            even if I can improve some leadership skills, it would be good.  </br> 
            Studying in a boot camp can help us benefit from technology and a strong support core in times of need. </br> 
            I try to organize my tasks better and do what I need to do according to the time-table and team working.
             I try to research and work hard to learn better and gain more self-confidence
