    <p class="p-questions">
    1.	Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up 
    the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</p>
   
    <p class="answer">I was the head of a department (dough making department) in a bakery.
      Once a girl joined our group and I was teaching her, but after some time she started talking bad things behind my back. And the bad part was that my colleagues believed her, while I had worked there for at least 7 months before that girl and had already trained another girl in that bakery and we were good friends.
 
 I was very upset with the behavior of my old colleagues, especially my boss. That's why I decided to go, but I didn't want to go to another bakery. I thought it would be better to follow my passion and try to get back into a career in technology. So I signed up for Dev Academy and now I am here.
 Later, that girl talked behind bake of others, even her close friends, and gradually everyone noticed her ugly behavior and she resigned. 
 But now I think I should have followed my passion much earlier, because by following interests, you can enjoy life and work more.</p>
   
      <p class="p-questions">2.	Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values 
      and identity.</p>
   
      <p class="answer">Every person's morals are derived from his family, friends and relatives.  Whenever I hear criticism, I try to search within myself and if I find it right, I change myself.</p>
   
        <p class="p-questions"> 3.	Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</p>
   
        <p class="answer">I am a hardworking person who has always tried to do my best to get what I want.  I hope that my efforts during this course will be fruitful and meet my goals</p>
