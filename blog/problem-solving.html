        <h3> When I were blocked on a simple problem:</h3>

        <p class="p-questions">&#9655;  what was the problem?
  </p>

        <p class="answer">I had a problem that was simple, but not easy for me to solve. That was how to center things.
           It seems very easy, but there was a problem that hindered this set

          I think there was some interference in my code that didn't allow it to be centered

  </p>

        <p class="p-questions">&#9655; what problem-solving techniques did you use? 
  </p>

        <p class="answer">3 weeks ago,
          I started working on a small piece of code, so I think I used the psoducode method and 
          then tried to explain to another person what I did . Of course, no one was there, but I will explain to an imaginary person :)
          which is similar to the method of using the rubber ducky method.
          I also tried to solve the problem by reflecting on my learnings and experiences. 
          But finally I could not solve it at that time. I probably needed more learning and experience

  </p>

        <p class="p-questions">&#9655; how did you feel throughout the process?
  </p>

        <p class="answer"> My mind was very busy with it and after using each method, I felt very good and I thought I found the problem...
           But after seeing my page in the browser, I realized that I was not successful and I need another way to solve it.

   </p>

        <p class="p-questions">&#9655; what did you learn?
   </p>

        <p class="answer">&#9655; I learned that to be more successful I need to practice more and do more research on solving a problem.

        <p class="p-questions">&#9655; what was the problem? 
   </p>

        <p class="answer">A few days ago, I tried to change my blog navbar to dropdown menu, 
          as I had a lot of pages and there was not enough space on navbar for them. 
          I googled and found that how should write the code on html for it.
           i realised that it needs css to work, and html is not enough for it. 
          So, I tried to find how to write css for it to have dropdown menu, 
  </p>

        <p class="p-questions">&#9655; what problem-solving techniques did you use?
  </p>

        <p class="answer">I googled and found out how to write the code in html for it. (I used the w3school webpage)
          I found that it needs css to work and html is not enough for it.
          So, I tried to find out how to write css to have a dropdown menu.
          I explained to an imaginary person (rubber ducky method) what I did and what I should do :)..
          I used Google again and couldn't solve it.
    </br>
           As I didn't get any results in solving the problem.
           So I asked the facilitator about it and I was still working on it.
           I thought there was a conflict in my code. So, I decided to set my code to comment, and I rewrote it, because 
          I googled more and found that writing css for it is very different and finally solved it. 
 </p>

        <p class="p-questions">&#9655; how did you feel throughout the process?
  </p>

        <p class="answer"> My mind was very busy with it and confused why it didn't work 

 </p>

        <p class="p-questions">&#9655; what did you learn?
</p>

        <p class="answer">&#9655; I found that working on a small piece of code and reviewing it can be very useful.
               And at the end I can rewrite the code of that part to avoid conflicts in the code, it will be very useful in finding an error.

          <p class="p-questions">&#9639;  Pseudocode:
      </p>
  
          <p class="answer">Pseudocode acts as the bridge between our brain and computer’s code executor. 
                It allows us to plan instructions which follow a logical pattern, without including all of the technical details.

                Pseudocode is a great way of getting started with software programming as a beginner. 
                we won’t have to overwhelm our brain with coding syntax. 
      </br>
               It is also much easier and more convenient to break our code into small steps 
               and work on small steps to find the code we need.
      </p>
  
          <p class="p-questions">&#9639;  Trying something:
     </p>
          <p class="answer">yeah.. sometimes something pops into my head and i try to test it to see if it works  
  
     </p>
  
          <p class="p-questions">&#9639; Rubber ducky method:
          </p>
  
          <p class="answer">I mostly explain the code to someone else, when I find an error in my coding (even if there's no one around me :))
               it helps me see the code I wrote better . 
         </br>
               The first thing I can solve with this method is that I can find typos, missing commas or semicolons.
  
          </p>
  
          <p class="p-questions">&#9639; Reading error messages:
      </p>
  
          <p class="answer"> it's a good way to find the error, but I think it's not enough.
          
       </p>
  
          <p class="p-questions">&#9639; Console.logging:
      </p>
  
          <p class="answer"> It's a very useful way to be sure about the code, and always I use it 
  
      </p>
  
          <p class="p-questions">&#9639; Googling:
      </p>
  
          <p class="answer"> The first thing I do when I want to write code is to google.
             and try to find out more about it.
      </br>       
              mostly I google the question and i can find some similar ones, then I try to write my code based on them 
              and in the end I use console.log(); to be sure about my answer.

          <p class="p-questions">&#9639; Asking your peers and coaches for help:
          </p>
  
          <p class="answer"> I ask my peers or coaches , If I can't solve the problem with all the above ways.
  
     </p>

          <p class="p-questions">&#9639; Improving your process with reflection:
      </p>
  
          <p class="answer"> this is another way for problem solving which I use is: Reflecting my learnings and 
            experiences and analyzing my experiences and
             comparing it with the models or principles I want to follow.
