          <p class="p-questions">o	What is Emotional Intelligence?</p>

            <p class="answer">Emotional Intelligence (EI) is the ability to manage both your own emotions and understand the emotions of people around you.</br>
               There are five key elements to EI: self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. 
                A high EQ helps us to build relationships, reduce team stress, defuse conflict and improve job satisfaction.</br>
                 Emotional intelligence is typically broken down into four core competencies:
               1- Self-awareness. 2- Self-management. 3- Social awareness. 4- Relationship management.</p>

            <p class="p-questions">o	How is EQ different to IQ?</p>

            <p class="answer">IQ is known as “Intelligence Quotient” and it's a measure of a person's relative intelligence. Emotional Quotient, also known as EQ, is the ability to identify and manage your emotions and the emotions of others.
               While IQ (Intelligence Quotient) is a measure of our ability to solve problems and think logically,
                EQ (Emotional Intelligence Quotient) measures our ability to understand and manage emotions.</br>
                 Our EQ can have a greater influence on our success in life than our IQ</br>
                 Having a low EQ can also attribute to similar behaviours. While generally those with high IQ's may find improvising easy as they can easily navigate problems that arise,
                  having a low EQ as well can lead to even riskier impulsive behaviours
                  
            <p class="p-questions">o	Why is EQ important?</p>

                 <p class="answer">Emotional intelligence is widely recognized as a valuable skill that helps improve communication, management, problem-solving, and relationships within the workplace. It is also a skill that researchers believe can be improved with training and practice.
                  Emotional Intelligence improves our self-control, and this allows us to stay calm and to react to situations in a calm and reflective manner. Instead of letting nerves negatively affect our communication, and instead of mumbling and talking very fast, we can stay relaxed and communicate clearly and effectively.
                  This ability helps in building effective work environment. Emotional intelligence can best be described as the ability to monitor one's own and other people's emotions, to discriminate between different emotions and label them appropriately, and to use emotional information to guide thinking and behavior.
